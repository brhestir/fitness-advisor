## Description

- Fitness Advisor is a cloud-based application allowing one to track: both resistance and cardio-based workouts, the duration of each exercise, the number of sets and repetitions performed, as well as weight lifted and / or distance covered for each activity.

- Total weight lifted and / or total distance covered for selected day is calculated and displayed.

- The dashboard feature uses Chart.js to display a workout activity summary for the week prior.
